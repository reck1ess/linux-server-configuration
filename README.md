# Linux Server Configuration

> This is the final project for Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004)

#### Objective

You will take a baseline installation of a Linux distribution on a virtual machine and prepare it to host your web applications, to include installing updates, securing it from a number of attack vectors and installing/configuring web and database servers.

#### Description

This page explains how to secure and set up a Linux distribution on a virtual machine, install and configure a web and database server to host a web application.

-   The Linux distribution is [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/server) 16.04 LTS.
-   The virtual private server is [Amazon Lighsail](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/).
-   The web application is my [Item Catalog project](https://github.com/reck1ess/item-catalog) created earlier in this Nanodegree program.
-   The database server is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
-   My local machine is a MacBook Pro (macOS Mojave 10.14.1)
-   Public IP Address: 13.125.200.246
-   URL: [http://ec2-13-209-11-93.ap-northeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com](http://ec2-13-209-11-93.ap-northeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com)
-   Accessible SSH port: 2200
